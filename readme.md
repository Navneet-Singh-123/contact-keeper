### Contact Keeper

This is a complete MERN stack application. 

The database that's being used is mongoDB Atlas. It has basically two schemas, one for the users and for each of those user there is a schema for his/her contact. 

Express is being used as the web application framework. This is really easy to configure and customise.
There are various other alternatives available for express like Koa and Hapi but in my opinion express has an edge over these frameworks.
It is fully customizable along with quite fast development. Almost standard for Node js applications
